season - spring/summer/autumn/winter



split BelowRoomTemperature into two classes (0-10 degrees, 10-20 degrees) - DONE
modify everything depending on BelowRoomTemperature afterwards - DONE


SWEET:
* units (degreesC, pascal, degrees, hour, millimeter,
wattPerMeterSquared, meterPerSecond) - problem



complete ant - DONE
document ant
document ontology
rewrite ontology
airingweather etc.
makefiles for abstract and thesis
more test cases for individuals using junit - DONE
more complex test cases using junit
make the project compileable with java 5, 6 and 7 - DONE

rewrite abstract (in english)
slides for seminar (latex beamer, makefile)
chapter: weatherservices

missing tasks?

some triple store?
output of ontologies created by test cases
test cases for WeatherReader? - using fake test XML files, containing certain data

evaluate if test cases can be simplified (using object-oriented design?) - DONE

manifest.mf for JAR file generated during "dist" ant task

conditions of use of http://api.yr.no/

Reread weather states

check for floating point calculation problems in:
* HumidityTest
* PressureTest
* TemperatureTest
* WindTest

methondology - in progress

interfacing with multi-agent system?

test if Jena rule inferencing engine works?
