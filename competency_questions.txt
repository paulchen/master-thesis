(Step 1 as in Ontology 101)


What is the domain the ontology will cover?

The ontology will cover the domain of information about current weather and weather in the near future, based on sensor observations and forecasts provided by Internet weather services.


For what are we going to use the ontology?

The ontology will be used in smart home environments to represent current and future weather conditions that influence on the building.


For what types of questions the information in the ontology should provide answers?

* What will the weather be in 3 hours?
* What is the current weather situation?
* What is the weather situation in 1 hour?
* What is the weather situation tomorrow (morning, afternoon, night)?
* What is the currnet air moisture?
* What is the current sun radiation?
* What is the predicted sun radiation in 3 hours?
* What is the wind speed?
* What is the current amount of precipitation?
* What is the barometric pressure?
* Will the weather change?
* Will temperature rise/fall?
* Will there be (is there) bright sunshine from East?
* Will it rain in the next few hours?
* Will it rain today?
* Will there be any sun today?
* Do we need to irrigate the garden?
* Does it rain (how intensive)?
* Will there be severe weather?
* Will there be danger of hail?
* How much power is expected to be produced today using photovoltaic?
* Shall we heat up water during the night (when electricity is cheaper) or during the day (using sunlight)?
* How warm will it be during the day/night? 
* Shall we take fresh air now or later?
* Can we expect fresh rain water?
* Will temperature drop below 0°C?
* Will it snow? Will it stay on the ground?
* Shall we close windows due to upcoming storm?
* Shall we turn on/off light outside?

TODO: what questions are useless because
  - they can't be answered using an ontology?
  - the data required is not provided by every/most weather service?
  - it's too complicated?
  - ...?


Who will use and maintain the ontology?

The ontology will be used in smart home systems like ThinkHome to add the capability to make control decisions based on current and future weather conditions.

TODO: maintainance?
