yr.no


Over the internet, there are many services providing weather data. Their differences are the functionality offered, the part of the world being covered, the values being provided, their terms of use, their price and the way one can interact with them. Compared to other services, yr.no is the one that fits ThinkHome's requirements best. yr.no [link to web page] is the joint online weather service from the Norwegian Meteorological Institute [web page?] and the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) [web page?] [http://met.no/English/Weather_forecast/]. Its API [http://api.yr.no/weatherapi/documentation] comes with the following advantages:

* It is completely free to use for private, academic and commercial uses as long as Norwegian law is not violated [http://api.yr.no/license.html]. There are only a few features that are not available freely, e.g. radar images. However, these are irrelevant for ThinkHome.

* The API is based on the REST paradigm [reference?].

* Weather data is available for any part of the world. For obtaining data, only latitude and longitude are required, the altitude above mean sea level is optional [http://api.yr.no/weatherapi/locationforecast/1.8/documentation]. 

* The API returns data in an XML format that is well-defined through a XML Schema definition [http://api.yr.no/weatherapi/locationforecast/1.8/documentation].

* Sunrise and sunset times are available [http://api.yr.no/weatherapi/sunrise/1.0/documentation].

* Available weather data includes forecasts over nine days using intervals from one hour over the next 24 hours to six hours for nine days in the future.

* Forecasts include weather conditions (e.g. SUN, PARTLYCLOUD, RAIN) temperature, wind direction, wind speed, humidity, atmospheric pressure, cloud coverage, fog and precipitation.

* Besides weather and sunrise/sunset times, yr.no offers a wide range of data, e.g. different types of forecasts and satellite images. However, this data is not relevant for the use within ThinkHome.


Unfortunately, there are a few possible disadvantages:

* yr.no is a Norwegian based weather service. Thus, one can raise the question if the weather data for locations outside Norway is accurate enough for ThinkHome's requirements.

* The API is subject to change [http://api.yr.no/faq.html#versions], hence every software using the API may require frequent updates.


Weather forecast data


For an arbitrary request, one must specify latitude and logitude (in degrees, nothern latitudes and eastern longitudes are represented by positive values) [http://api.yr.no/weatherapi/locationforecast/1.8/documentation]. Additionally, the altitude above sea level (in metres) may be specified for locations outside Norway. Based on this input data, a URL of the format

http://api.yr.no/weatherapi/locationforecast/1.8/?lat=<latitude>;lon=<longtude>

or

http://api.yr.no/weatherapi/locationforecast/1.8/?lat=<latitude>;lon=<longtude>;msl=<altitude>

is built, e.g.

http://api.yr.no/weatherapi/locationforecast/1.8/?lat=48.21;lon=16.37;msl=171

for the city of Vienna, Austria. A GET request to this URL returns an XML document conforming to the XML Schema definition that can be found at http://api.yr.no/weatherapi/locationforecast/1.8/schema.

The structure of the XML document is as follows (attributes are omitted for better readability):

<weatherdata>
	<meta>
		<model />
	</meta>
	<product>
		/* ... */
	</product>
</weatherdata>

The attributes of the <model> element specify when the forecast has been created, when it will be updated for the next time and what date and time of the first and the last forecast returned are.

There is an arbitrary number of <time> elements that are children of the <product> element. Every <time> element represents the weather forecast for a certain period of time. Each <time> element has a <location> element that has a child element for each weather property.

This is a typical <time> element:

<time datatype="forecast" from="2011-10-17T09:00:00Z" to="2011-10-17T09:00:00Z">
	<location altitude="171" latitude="48.2100" longitude="16.3700">
		<temperature id="TTT" unit="celcius" value="8.5" />
		<windDirection id="dd" deg="140.3" name="SE" />
		<windSpeed id="ff" mps="4.5" beaufort="3" name="Lett bris" />
		<humidity value="45.1" unit="percent" />
		<pressure id="pr" unit="hPa" value="1027.6" />
		<cloudiness id="NN" percent="0.0" />
		<fog id="FOG" percent="0.0" />
		<lowClouds id="LOW" percent="0.0" />
		<mediumClouds id="MEDIUM" percent="0.0" />
		<highClouds id="HIGH" percent="0.0" />
	</location>
</time>

The names of the elements that are allowed to be children of the <location> element are: groundCover, pressure, maximumPrecipitation, highestTemperature, lowestTemperature, precipitation, fog, cloudiness, lowClouds, mediumClouds, highClouds, temperature, dewpointTemperature, minTemperatureDay, minTemperatureNight, maxTemperatureDay, maxTemperatureNight, uv, tidalwater, currentDirection, maxWaveHeight, surfaceTemperature, waveDirection, wavePeriod, waveHeight, humidity, bias, numberofobservations, meanabsoluteerror, score, windDirection, windSpeed, maxWindSpeed, stateOfTheSea, snowDepth, weather, symbol, forest-fire, windProbability, temperatureProbability and symbolProbability.

None of the child elements are required. However, for most places of the world, the XML document contains <location> elements having two different sets of child elements:

* Some <location> elements have the child elements temperature, windDirection, windSpeed, humidity, pressure, cloudiness, fog, lowClouds, mediumClouds and highClouds (as shown above). The values of the attributes from and to of the enclosing <time> element are equal.

* Some <location> elements have the child elements precipitation and symbol; the values of the attributes from and to of the enclosing <time> element differ by three to six hours; such an element looks like this:

<time datatype="forecast" from="2011-10-17T03:00:00Z" to="2011-10-17T09:00:00Z">
	<location altitude="171" latitude="48.2100" longitude="16.3700">
		<precipitation unit="mm" value="0.0" />
		<symbol id="SUN" number="1" />
	</location>
</time>

The content of the XML document covers a period of nine days, starting at the current day.


Sunrise and sunset times


Sunrise and sunset times may be useful for ThinkHome. Hence, the data provided by yr.no's Sunrise API can be used [http://api.yr.no/weatherapi/sunrise/1.0/documentation].

Mandatory input parameters are latitude and longitude in degrees (nothern latitudes and eastern longitudes are represented by positive values). Furthermore, either a single date or a date range must be provided (using the format YYYY-MM-DD. The URLs have one of the following formats:

* http://api.yr.no/weatherapi/sunrise/1.0/?lat=<latitude>;lon=<longitude>;date=<date>

* http://api.yr.no/weatherapi/sunrise/1.0/?lat=<latitude>;lon=<longitude>;from=<date>;to=<date>

E.g., for the city of Vienna, Austria, for 2011-11-01 and November 2011, respectively:

* http://api.yr.no/weatherapi/sunrise/1.0/?lat=48.21;lon=16.37;date=2011-11-01

* http://api.yr.no/weatherapi/sunrise/1.0/?lat=48.21;lon=16.37;from=2011-11-01;to=2011-11-30

In both cases, a GET request to the URL will yield a XML document being valid with regard to the XML schema definition that can be found at http://api.yr.no/weatherapi/sunrise/1.0/schema. Its structure is as follows (attributed are omitted for better readability):

<astrodata>
	<meta />
	<time>
		<location>
			<sun>
				<noon />
			</sun>
			<moon />
		</location>
	</time>
</astrodata>

The <meta> element only gives the URL of the API's licence. The <time> element may occur any number of times, depending on the date or date range specified in the request URL. For each day in the specified range, there is exactly one <time> element.

The <sun> element has two attributes, rise and set, giving the time of sunrise and sunset on this day. The <noon> element provides the angle between the sun's position and the horizon in degrees at solar noon (at the sun's peak on that day). The <moon> element specifies the current moon phase and moonrise and moonset times for this day.

This is an example <time> element:

<time date="2011-11-01">
	<location latitude="48.21" longitude="16.37">
		<sun rise="2011-11-01T05:39:08Z" set="2011-11-01T15:36:27Z">
			<noon altitude="27.4329172212036"/>
		</sun>
		<moon phase="First quarter" rise="2011-11-01T11:14:14Z" set="2011-11-01T21:01:27Z"/>
	</location>
</time>
