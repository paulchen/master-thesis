  abstract = {Smart homes have become increasingly popular
in the past few years. Similarly, new buildings are nowadays
planned and built following sustainability guidelines. Energy
efficient residential homes have gained importance for two
reasons. They contribute to the protection of our environment
and they simultaneously reduce operational costs over the whole
building lifecycle. However, the full potential of smart homes
still lies fallow due to the high complexity of the underlying
automation systems as well as the physical processes that are to be
controlled. This is the motivation to review smart homes under a
digital ecosystem perspective. With respect to this viewpoint, this
paper proposes a system concept that applies artificial intelligence
in smart homes. Main goals are to minimize energy consumption
while at the same time guaranteeing user comfort. Therefore,
intelligent control strategies are developed that take a multitude
of parameters into consideration and operate automatically. For
this purpose, an agent part populated by a society of autonomous
agents that implement artificial intelligence is developed. It is
supported by an ontology based knowledge representation that
contains all relevant data in a structured way.},
