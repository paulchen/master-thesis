ThinkHome Weather Ontology
===========================

Description according to Methontology approach



Specification
---------------

Domain: Weather
Date: 2012
Purpose: Ontology covering data about weather phenomena occurring at a certain location somewhere on Earth between the present and 24 hours in the future. Weather data will come from both internet services as well as from weather sensors mounted to the building.
Level of formality: Formal (?)
Scope:
* Weather observation: all relevant weather data that can be obtained for a certain location over the next 24 hours
* Weather phenomena: temperature, humidity, wind, ...
* Weather conditions: sunshine, rain, thunder, ...
* Weather state: current weather, weather in 1 hour, ..., weather in 24 hours
* Weather source: weather from sensors

Sources of knowledge (TODO):
* data in weather reports
* data available from sensors
* data required by/useful for ThinkHome
* other weather ontologies
* glossary of weather reports (see link at Dan Arkoff)
