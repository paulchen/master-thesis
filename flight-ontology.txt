Ontology for Flights

assumptions:
* flight only from one airport to another; not from one airport to itself, not from A to B to C
* flight always flown by the same aircraft
* airports, aircraft and aircraft types will never change; hence, these values are fixed

* specification document/competency questions

* knowledge acquisition

* glossary of terms
  location, airport, flight, aircraft, aircraft type, cargo aircraft type, passenger aircraft type
  iata code, registration number

* concept-classification trees
  location-airport

* binary relations diagram
  * departure airport, arrival airport - some super-property? - 
  * <flight> flown by <aircraft>
  * <aircraft> has type <aircraft type>
  * inverse properties

* concept dictionary

* instance attribute tables
  location name, iata code, aircraft name, registration number type name, flight number

* class attribute tables
  aircraft type - transports - cargo/passenger => cargo aircraft type/passenger aircraft type

* constants
  TODO

* logical axioms table
  * a flight can't start and end at the same airport

* formula tables (rules)
  * flight with cargo aircraft: cargo flight

* instances
  airport: VIE, MUC, FRA, ZRH
  aircraft type: dash 8-400, boeing 767-freighter
  aircraft: dash8: OE-LGA, OE-LGB, OE-LGC; b767: N301UP, N302UP, N303UP
