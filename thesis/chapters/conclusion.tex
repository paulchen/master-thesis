Additionally, the \emph{Weather Importer} which is presented in chapter ? represents a modular Java project for importing weather data from a weather service via Internet into an object-oriented data model. The data can then be filled into the \thinkhomeweather ontology for %TODO what?

\section{Outlook}

\begin{comment}
% TODO reference sections instead of chapters?
Chapters ?, ? and ? describe some of the shortcomings that come with OWL and all ontologies being used by \thinkhomeweather. The main problems arising are:

% TODO e.g. owl-time not usable
% TODO units system -- slow, unusable
% TODO geo ontology
% TODO bugs in protege
\begin{itemize}
  \item First problem.
  \item Second problem.
\end{itemize}

OWL will have a long way to go to overcome these shortcomings in order to further ease definition of ontologies that handle specific domains.

% TODO

As discussed in section ?, the performance is not the yellow from the egg.

Use a different reasoner? (Modifications needed)

Change the internal structure without altering symbols that are used internally.

Eliminate unnecessary terms.
