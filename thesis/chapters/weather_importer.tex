\chapter{The Weather Importer}
\label{ch:weather}

% TODO after discussing the ontology creation in chapter ? and online weather services in chapter ? and yr.no in special in section ?, the ontology needs to be populated with data:
% individuals of certain types having attributes that together comprise all data about 

% Java weather importer: only from Internet weather service

% reference implementation: yr.no; there is an interface called ? that can be implemented to fetch data from any weather service

% describe OntologyClass better

% ant, jena, pellet -- tested with which versions at the time of writing?

% unit testing: junit, cobertura; test coverage - what is tested, what is omitted

% property file

% data model: UML class diagram, package diagram? describe

% mention javadoc

% structure of the program: UML class diagram/package diagram

% modi operandi of the importer: fetch, turtle, update, remove

% turtle output (initially only for debug reasons); does not use Jena

% appendix: example turtle output

% this is only for service data; what about sensor data?
