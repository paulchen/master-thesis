\section{Motivation}

Over the last years, the idea of designing and building smart homes gained increasing popularity. According to the \emph{Intertek Research \& Testing Centre}\footnote{\href{http://www.its-rtc.com/}{http://www.its-rtc.com/}} who carried out a smart home project named \emph{DTI Smart Home Project}, a smart home is ``a dwelling incorporating a communications network that connects the key electrical appliances and services, and allows them to be remotely controlled, monitored or accessed. Remotely in this context can mean both within the dwelling and from outside the dwelling''~\cite{SmartHomeDefinition,SmartHomeResearch}. By utilizing these components, a smart home can be equipped with some kind of intelligence which enables the home to take work from its inhabitants. The goals that become reachable by that approach are diverse: For instance, smart homes may be aimed at making their inhabitants' lives easier or at reducing the overall energy consumption without any loss of comfort. % TODO some more uses?

% TODO why are smart homes so imporant?

As smart homes comprise a large field of research and development, there are several projects that are aimed at developing infrastructures for smart homes. Some of these projects are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Project 1}: …
  \item \textbf{Project 2}: …
  \item \textbf{Project 3}: …
\end{itemize}

This thesis belongs to a smart home project named \thinkhome which is developed at the \emph{Institute of Computer Aided Automation} at the \emph{Vienna University of Technology}\footnote{\href{https://www.auto.tuwien.ac.at/projectsites/thinkhome/overview.html}{https://www.auto.tuwien.ac.at/projectsites/thinkhome/overview.html}}~\cite{CR2011-TH_Journal,CR2010-DEST_ThinkHome}.

\section{Problem statement and goal}

The aim of this thesis is the development of a data model for weather data which will be utilized by \thinkhome. Apart from current weather data, this model will cover future weather data over a range suitable for the use within \thinkhome. This enables \thinkhome to use current and future states of the weather as a source of knowledge for making control decisions. While data about the current weather state can be obtained from various sensors that are installed at the building, data about future weather states must be gathered from weather services that provide forecasts for the desired period. There is a wide range of weather services available over the Internet which can be utilized for this purpose.

\section{Methodological Approach}

There are several existing approaches for providing weather data to smart homes as well as several approaches for covering weather data using (\emph{OWL}) ontologies. These approaches analyzed in order to determine whether they are suitable for being reused for \thinkhome. However, as chapter~\ref{ch:existing_work} discusses, none of them suits \thinkhome's requirements. Thus, the approaches previously analyzed are reviewed for their structure, their advantages and their disadvantages.

Furthermore, a set of weather services that are available via Internet is reviewed, regarding the type of data they provide and whether they suit the requirements of a smart home. Based on these requirements and the data provided by weather sensors and Internet weather services, the data which can be provided to \thinkhome is identified, i.e. a set of weather properties (e.g. temperature or humidity) and the time range that will be covered. One of the services is selected that will later be used to develop a reference implementation for the import of weather data.

\section{Outline}

Chapter~\ref{ch:existing_work} discusses existing work regarding integration of weather data into \smarthome systems, ontologies for weather data and ontologies that may be imported by a weather ontology for \thinkhome.

Chapter~\ref{ch:weather_data} examines various sources for weather data and determines the scope of weather data that is relevant to \thinkhome and that will be used in the ontology.

In chapter~\ref{ch:development_approaches} various well-known approaches for developing ontologies are presented. Their suitability for designing an ontology for \thinkhome is evaluated and the best-suited approach is identified.

Chapter~\ref{ch:thinkhomeweather_ontology} describes the process of developing the ontology.

In chapter~\ref{ch:weather} a Java application is presented that gathers weather data from appropriate services and provides them to the \thinkhome ontology.

Finally, chapter~\ref{ch:conclusion} concludes about the insights from the previous chapters, summarizes all findings and gives an outlook about future work.

Appendix~\ref{ch:listings} contains all tables and listings that are omitted from the previous chapters as they are only required for reference and completeness, but not for understanding the topics covered by the previous chapters.

Appendix~\ref{main} contains the Glossary of Terms.

\section{General Information}

This document is intended as a template and guideline and should support the author in the course of doing the master's thesis.
Assessment criteria comprise the quality of the theoretical and/or practical work as well as structure, content and wording of the written master's thesis. Careful attention should be given to the basics of scientific work (e.g., correct citation).

\section{Organizational Issues}

A master's thesis at the Faculty of Informatics has to be finished within six months. During this period regular meetings between the advisor(s) and the author have to take place.
In addition, the following milestones have to be fulfilled:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item  Within one month after having fixed the topic of the thesis the master's thesis proposal has to be prepared and must be accepted by the advisor(s). The master's thesis proposal must follow the respective template of the dean of academic affairs. Thereafter the proposal has to be applied for at the deanery. The necessary forms may be found on the web site of the Faculty of Informatics. \url{http://www.informatik.tuwien.ac.at/dekanat/formulare.html}
  \item  Accompanied with the master's thesis proposal, the structure of the thesis in terms of a table of contents has to be provided.
  \item Then, the first talk has to be given at the so-called ``Seminar for Master Students''. The slides have to be discussed with the advisor(s) one week in advance. Attendance of the ``Seminar for Master Students'' is compulsory and offers the opportunity to discuss arising problems among other master students.
  \item At the latest five months after the beginning, a provisional final version of the thesis has to be handed over to the advisor(s).  
  \item As soon as the provisional final version exists, a first poster draft has to be made. The making of a poster is a compulsory part of the ``Seminar for Master Students'' for all master studies at the Faculty of Informatics. Drafts and design guidelines can be found at \url{http://www.informatik.tuwien.ac.at/studium/richtlinien}.
  \item After having consulted the advisor(s) the second talk has to be held at the ``Seminar for Master Students''.
  \item At the latest six months after the beginning, the corrected version of the master's thesis and the poster have to be handed over to the advisor(s).
  \item After completion the master's thesis has to be presented at the ``epilog''. For detailed information on the epilog see: \\ \url{http://www.informatik.tuwien.ac.at/studium/epilog}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Structure of the Master's Thesis}

If the curriculum regulates the language of the master's thesis to be English (like for ``Business Informatics''), the thesis has to be written in English. Otherwise, the master's thesis may be written in English or in German. The structure of the thesis is predetermined.
The table of contents is followed by the introduction and the main part, which can vary according to the content. The master's thesis ends with the bibliography (compulsory) and the appendix (optional).
