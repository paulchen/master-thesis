\chapter{Existing work}
\label{ch:existing_work}

The first part of this chapter covers the foundations the thesis builds upon. It gives introductions into all revelant topics, e.g. ontologies, \eacs{RDF} and \eacs{OWL}. Furthermore, it discusses the basic principles of \thinkhome which are required in order to fully understand the ideas behind the weather data model which is designed in later chapters.

% TODO repetition: conclude, conclusion
The second part sheds light on a selection of existing work regarding weather data in smart homes and ontologies for weather data. Additionally, some ontologies which may be reused in an ontology for weather data are discussed. The conclusion at the end of this chapter reviews all ontologies that are presented and makes decisions regarding which elements can be used for \thinkhome.
