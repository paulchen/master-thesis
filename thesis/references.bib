The SOS is one of a family of standards and specifications that make up theOGC Sensor Web Enablement activity, hereinafter  ” SWE”. Currently, the otherspecifications that pertain to SWE are Sensor Model Language (SensorML),Observations and Measurements (O\&M), Sensor Planning Service (SPS), TransducerMarkup Language (TML), Sensor Alert Service (SAS), and Web Notification Service(WNS). Work on the predecessor to SOS, Sensor Collection Service (SCS), beganduring the OGC Web Services 1.1 (OWS 1.1) testbed initiative and focused mainly onthe interoperable interface requirements for in-situ sensors and sensor networks. Duringthe OWS 1.2 initiative, the SCS effort focused on the requirements for dynamic remotesensors (and sensor networks) and defined a more explicit interface employingSensorML. The SOS builds on previous SCS efforts and also incorporates an interfaceemploying TML.Suggested additions, 
changes, and comments on this standard are welcome andencouraged. Such suggestions may be submitted by OGC portal message, email message,or by making suggested changes in an edited copy of this document.This specification deprecates previous versions including version 05-088.}},

Roughly speaking, we extend SHOIN with all expressive means that were suggested to us by ontology developers as useful additions to OWL-DL, and which, additionally, do not affect its decidability and practicability. We consider complex role inclusion axioms of the form R  S Ë™v R or S  R Ë™v R to express propagation of one property along another one, which have proven useful in medical terminologies. Furthermore, we extend SHOIN with reflexive, antisymmetric, and irreflexive roles, disjoint roles, a universal role, and constructs 9R.Self, allowing, for instance, the definition of concepts such as a {\grqq}narcistâ€. Finally, we consider negated role assertions in Aboxes and qualified number restrictions. The resulting logic is called SROIQ. We present a rather elegant tableau-based reasoning algorithm: it combines the use of automata to keep track of universal value restrictions with the techniques developed for SHOIQ. The logic SROIQ has been adopted as the logical basis for the next iteration of OWL, OWL 1.1."
