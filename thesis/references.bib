  abstract = {Smart homes have become increasingly popular
in the past few years. Similarly, new buildings are nowadays
planned and built following sustainability guidelines. Energy
efficient residential homes have gained importance for two
reasons. They contribute to the protection of our environment
and they simultaneously reduce operational costs over the whole
building lifecycle. However, the full potential of smart homes
still lies fallow due to the high complexity of the underlying
automation systems as well as the physical processes that are to be
controlled. This is the motivation to review smart homes under a
digital ecosystem perspective. With respect to this viewpoint, this
paper proposes a system concept that applies artificial intelligence
in smart homes. Main goals are to minimize energy consumption
while at the same time guaranteeing user comfort. Therefore,
intelligent control strategies are developed that take a multitude
of parameters into consideration and operate automatically. For
this purpose, an agent part populated by a society of autonomous
agents that implement artificial intelligence is developed. It is
supported by an ontology based knowledge representation that
contains all relevant data in a structured way.},

    abstract = {{This document specifies the interface to a Sensor Observation Service, hereinafter ” SOS”. The SOS is one of a family of standards and specifications that make up theOGC Sensor Web Enablement activity, hereinafter  ” SWE”. Currently, the otherspecifications that pertain to SWE are Sensor Model Language (SensorML),Observations and Measurements (O\&M), Sensor Planning Service (SPS), TransducerMarkup Language (TML), Sensor Alert Service (SAS), and Web Notification Service(WNS). Work on the predecessor to SOS, Sensor Collection Service (SCS), beganduring the OGC Web Services 1.1 (OWS 1.1) testbed initiative and focused mainly onthe interoperable interface requirements for in-situ sensors and sensor networks. Duringthe OWS 1.2 initiative, the SCS effort focused on the requirements for dynamic remotesensors (and sensor networks) and defined a more explicit interface employingSensorML. The SOS builds on previous SCS efforts and also incorporates an interfaceemploying TML.Suggested additions, 
changes, and comments on this standard are welcome andencouraged. Such suggestions may be submitted by OGC portal message, email message,or by making suggested changes in an edited copy of this document.This specification deprecates previous versions including version 05-088.}},
